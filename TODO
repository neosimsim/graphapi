- testing, in particular concurrency
- haddock, including checker for existing documentation
- lock query folder if read
- init graph on startup

different approaches

1.	generalize file watcher (FSNotify)

2.	replace the IORef graph by a Monad GraphRepo, compare to State monad of
	LYAH
3.	Change the lock file by a "in progress" file.

	The server then reads the result file and response after the "in progress"
	file has been deleted. Using thin approach the result file can be written
	in chunks.

	Also we can use a lock and done file.
4.	Only write query if not allready present.

	By this it aktually doesn't matter if two instances process the same query.
